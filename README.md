# Fault Injector for ESP8266 and Arduino Boards 

![Intro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PythonHacker24/fault-injector/main/images/intro-image.png)

Fault Injection Attacks is an hardware attack that glitches a hardware circuit to behave in a way which is not intended and cause uncertain behaviour that would be useful for a hacker. 

Provided code injects a fault of specified duration and amplitude which can be interfaced with other circuits to perform a fault injection attack. 

This attack is useful in cases of jumping instructions inside a microprocessor or microcontrollers by gltiching the power supply to the chip. This maybe useful for escaping loops, bypassing authentication, etc. More destructive results can be obtained in cases of glitches that has undefined parameters set and may cause the whole electronic circuit to become unusuable due to deleting firmwares or bootloaders. 

Note that this attack can unintentionally damage the circuit due to a lot of factors. Hence, use this tool wih caution.
